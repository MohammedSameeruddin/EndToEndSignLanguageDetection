# EndToEndSignLanguageDetection
End-to-end sign language detection using YOLOv5 involves several steps, from data preparation to training and inference. YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, can be adapted for sign language detection by treating signs as objects to be detected. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how you might approach this:
